# JumpDash
A Geometry Dash inspired game in Haskell

## Setup
To run the game you need GHC and Cabal installed.

To set up the game, run the following from the root folder JumpDash: 

cabal build 

cabal run

## Tests
The tests are iuincluded within the main file and are run before the game starts automatically. I was originally planning to have them in a separate folder, but had problems with imports and configurations.
